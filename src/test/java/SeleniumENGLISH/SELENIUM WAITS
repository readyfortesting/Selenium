15)     What are the Selenium Waits?  !!!!**Thread.sleep() is NOT SELENIUM WAIT, it is a JAVA WAIT !!!!
   => There are 3 selenium waits. Implicit,Explicit, Fluent wait. They are dynamic,we use them for wait issue or synchronization issue.

       Can we use both implicit and explicit wait together?
 => Technically yes we can use them together but NOT RECOMMENDED,because it might put additional wait.

       Which one do you prefer,Why?
 => I have an implicit wait in my TestBase class.It is very useful,because it handles minor wait issues.
 However, I personally like explicit wait, because it works really well in expected conditions,such as when element is not visible
 or load takes time, or element is not visible, or when there is a pop up, then explicit wait works better.
 Manuel testing helps me to understand when specially use explicit wait.

      What is the difference between implicit and explicit wait?
 =>  1. Implicit wait is GLOBAL WAIT,it applies the wait automatically whenever driver is called.
        Explicit wait is LOCAL WAIT, it can only be applied specific elements.


     2. Explicit wait performance better especially under specific expected conditions. ( load takes time, or element is not visible, or when there is a pop up, then explicit wait works better).

     3. Implicit wait has only one syntax.  //   driver.manage().timeouts().implicitlyWait(Duration.ofSeconds(10));
        Explicit wait has more than one condition.

     4. WebDriverWait object must be created for  Explicit wait.


 => We cannot use explicit wait in TestBase because it is specific condition,case by case,element by element. We have to use explicit wait for ONLY ONE ELEMENT!
  But we can use implicit wait once in TestBase and it will automatically apply because IMPLICIT WAIT IS GLOBAL!!

    When your test case might fail?What are the possible reasons?
 => Wrong locator (very common),Wait issue ,Page is slow,Element can be inside the Iframe or Alert, database issue, page can be heavy(multiple iframes,videos,popups...)
or computer is slow-internet issue


    What do you do when your test case fail?
 => 1-READ the ERROR log/messge on the console. 2- DOUBLE CHECK ALWAYS.  3- Manuel test one more time (STEP BY STEP)
    4-TRY DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS BASED ON THE ERROR.
    5- IF YOU CANNOT FIGURE OUT THE SOLUTION FOR AUTOMATION,CHECK WITH YOUR TEAM MATES(ESPACIALLY LEADS)
****DON'T BE SHY FOR ASKING YOUR QUESTIONS,BUT RESEARCH YOUR QUESTIONS FIRST TO UNDERSTAND WHAT TO DO BETTER.
(Is there any recording that I can watch, is there any sample test case for researching, or can we do this test case together?)
